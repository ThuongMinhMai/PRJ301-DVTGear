**Users of the system:**

\- DVT Store: Customers who visit the e-commerce store to browse and purchase ice cream products.

\- DVT Admin: Administrators responsible for managing the DVT Store's products, orders, and overall operations.

**Features of the system (classified by user type):**

*- For Customers (DVT Store):*
